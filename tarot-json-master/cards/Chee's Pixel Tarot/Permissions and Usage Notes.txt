Other Notes:

-Flash Reveal is a sprite sheet that can be used as an effect that reveals cards. This sheet is 4 frames across and 2 frames down. The third frame of this animation is completely opaque, therefore you can change out the card face beneath it mid-animation. You can view it in action on the itch.io page for this package.

-A document of Card Meanings is included for your convenience. I've made it pretty simplistic so you may wish to do deeper research on card meanings on your own.

-Two sizes have been included (1x which is 100% size at 79 x 139, and 2x which is doubled) but if you need to resize them again, be sure to have the resampling mode listed as "Nearest Neighbor" in your photo editing software for the best results. Some game engines are capable of resizing pixel art without affecting the crisp pixel look as well.
