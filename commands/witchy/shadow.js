            .addField(`Regecting Your shadow`, `Rejecting, suppressing, denying, or disowning your Shadow, whether consciously or unconsciously, is a dangerous thing. The thing about the Shadow Self is that it seeks to be known. It wants to be understood, explored, and integrated. The longer the Shadow stays buried and locked in its jail cell deep within the unconscious, the more it will find opportunities to make you aware of its existence.
             Issues that arise when we reject our Shadow side can include:
            
            Hypocrisy
            Lies
            Uncontrollable bursts of rage/anger
            Emotional and mental manipulation of others
            Greed and addictions
            Phobias and obsessive compulsions
            ||Racist, sexist, homophobic, and other offensive behavior||
            Intense anxiety
            Chronic psychosomatic illness
            ||Depression (which can turn into suicidal tendencies)||
            ||Sexual perversion||
            Narcissistically inflated ego
            Chaotic relationships with others
            Self-absorption
            Self-sabotage`)
